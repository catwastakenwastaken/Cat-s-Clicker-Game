-- Cat's Clicker Game --

YOU MAY REDISTRIBUTE THIS CODE, BUT DO GIVE CREDIT.

Hi! Cat here. This is my Clicker Game I decided to create. It was originally in C++ format until I couldn't figure out how to do OpenGL libraries. I might add the C++ .exe file if I ever figure it out.

You have to have Java to run this .jar file, as I do not have a JRE associated with this file as of October 24, 2024.

Happy clicking.
